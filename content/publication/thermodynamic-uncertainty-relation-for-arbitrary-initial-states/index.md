abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) describes a trade-off
  relation between nonequilibrium currents and entropy production and serves as
  a fundamental principle of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. However, currently
  known TURs presuppose either specific initial states or an infinite-time
  average, which severely limits the range of applicability. Here we derive a
  finite-time TUR valid for arbitrary initial states from the Cramér-Rao
  inequality. We find that the variance of an accumulated current is bounded
  from below by the instantaneous current at the final time, which suggests that
  “the boundary is constrained by the bulk”. We apply our results to
  feedback-controlled processes and successfully explain a recent experiment
  which reports a violation of a modified TUR with feedback control. We also
  derive a TUR that is linear in the total entropy production and valid for
  discrete-time Markov chains with nonsteady initial states. The obtained bound
  exponentially improves the existing bounds in a discrete-time regime.
